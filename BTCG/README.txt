Basic Team Changer GUI Version 1 (02/19/2022)
Scripted by DontEatThemCookies

The Basic Team Changer GUI is exactly what its
name entails. It's really simple to set up:

1. Place "TeamGui" in StarterGui
2. Setup is complete!

BTCG automatically makes buttons for each team
and colored the team's color, so you don't have 
to manually make or configure any buttons. Also,
the team buttons are sorted alphabetically.

This system is completely config-free. This also means
that GROUP-ONLY/RANK-ONLY TEAMS ARE NOT SUPPORTED!
